# tagbrewer

Package for generating the tags used by [Decombinator](https://github.com/innate2adaptive/Decombinator).

Decombinator uses short, 20 bp sequences (also referred to as tags) to identify and assign V(D)J genes present in FASTQ reads.
This repository contains a work-in-progress package for automating the generation process.
